    <h2 class="headerrv">Description</h2>

    <p>The perfect red velvet layer cake. Not only is the flavor outstanding, this red velvet cake's texture is worth writing home about. It's dense and soft with a moist and velvety crumb. However, the absolute best part about red velvet cake is the cream cheese frosting. Slathered on thick, this cream cheese frosting recipe is delicately sweet and undeniably creamy.</p>

    <h2 class="headerrv">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) bottles red food coloring</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds confectioners' sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

        <h2 class="headerrv">Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 9-inch cake pans.</li>
            <li>Pour red food coloring into a small bowl, and mix with cocoa powder to make a paste. In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup of butter, sugar, and eggs with an electric mixer until smooth and thoroughly combined; mix in the red color mixture, salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Gradually mix in the buttermilk, alternating with flour, until the batter is smooth. Mix the baking soda and vinegar in a small bowl, and stir into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cake comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing cakes to finish cooling on racks.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mash cream cheese with 1/2 cup softened butter and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract until smooth and creamy; stir in the confectioners' sugar, about half a cup at a time, until the frosting is thick and spreadable. Frost fully-cooled layers.</li>
        </ol>
